CYT is targeted towards the use on Linux x86_64 computers. The main distribution form is via a Docker image, and so other operating systems are supported as well. However, for optimal performance we strongly recommend a Linux installation.

We also distribute CYT as a standalone Python package with limited functionality. The advantage of this is an easier installation at the cost of various features. This option is only available for Linux.

We provide instructions for the following operating systems.

#### [Linux](./linux)
#### [macOS](./macos)
#### [Windows](./windows)

We also provide a [tutorial](./tutorial) that showcases some of the most important functionality.
