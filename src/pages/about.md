# About CYT

CYT is a software package developed by LM's group with the purpose of studying Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in toric varieties. The current lead developers are MD and ART.

Most of the tools are in the form of a Python package available from the Python Package Index (PyPI) at [https://pypi.org/project/cyt/](https://pypi.org/project/cyt/). The full package comes in the form of a Docker image and includes additional open-source software for extended functionality.

CYT makes use of a variety of open-source projects including:

* [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/)
* [TOPCOM](http://www.rambau.wm.uni-bayreuth.de/TOPCOM/)
* [The Computational Geometry Algorithms Library](https://www.cgal.org/)
